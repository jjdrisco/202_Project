# Global Art Exploration and Analysis
in Neo4j, Postgresql, Redis

*By: John Driscoll, Taylor Martinez, Thuy Nguyen*

Abstract:

This research employs an innovative multi-database architecture (PostgreSQL, Neo4j, Redis) integrating the MoMA dataset, PainterPalette, WikiData, and Google Trends to analyze artistic influence networks and public engagement patterns. Our investigation into whether prolific artists from influential movements trend together revealed that artists within the same movement rarely share popularity trends, with unexpected cross-movement correlations. Recent artist passings create measurable popularity ripples across their professional networks, with immediate and delayed effects on connected artists. Additional investigation into the impacts of the Los Angeles wildfires shows that physical cultural repositories generate distinct public engagement patterns compared to individual artists during crises. This work demonstrates how specialized database integration enables complex cultural analytics that reveal nuanced patterns of artistic influence, legacy propagation, and public engagement with cultural heritage.
